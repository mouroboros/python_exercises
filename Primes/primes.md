# Primes

A non TDD kata to warm up.

Write a function which takes an integer and prints the next prime in the sequence.

>> next_primes(4)
5
>>> next_prime(25)
29

## Lessons:

None really - it's a warm up. However it's worth noting that 

>> 3 % 1
0
>> 5 % 4 
1

Also - make sure to use unit tests. Trust me ...

Once your code works. Think how did you approach the solution?
