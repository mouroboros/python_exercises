# Pangram

A non TDD Kata to get you used to string operations.

Write a function which takes as input a string and returns true if the string contains every letter in the alphabet.

e.g. 

>> pangram("the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
True

>> pangram("the fast orange fox jumps over the lazy cat")
False

## Lessons
