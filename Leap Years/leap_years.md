# Leap Years

A non TDD Kata to learn Python.

Write a function which returns whether or not a year is a leap year. 

One year has the length of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 45 seconds. This is hard to calculate with, so a normal year has been given 365 days and a leap year 366 days. In leap years, February 29th is added as leap day, which doesn't exist in a normal year. A leap year is every 4 years, but not every 100 years, then again every 400 years.
