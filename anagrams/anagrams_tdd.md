# Anagram Kata

This is a pure *TDD* Kata. It might be your first. If so recall how TDD works:

1. Write a test
2. Does it fail? Go to 2. Does it pass go to 3.
2. Write minimal Code to pass the test
3. Refactor? If so - 
4. Repeat until you've solved the problem.

*Don't write code unless you have a test!*

## The problem

Write a function which :

* Reads from a file with one word per line
* Outputs all other words which are anagrams of the current word read AND in the file.

A file "words.txt" is available for testing.


## Lessons

This should be relatively straight forward but think carefully about what to test and in what order. Learning what to test and when is the main lesson of this Kata.

Moving from small unit tests to test internal behaviour to overall correctness should give you a working solution.

Note the specification above is under specified so you'll need to make some design choices yourself.
