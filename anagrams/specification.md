## Anagram Kata

Write a function which :

* Reads from a file with one word per line
* Outputs all other words which are anagrams of the current word read AND in the file.

A file "words.txt" is available for testing.


Hints and Tips

This should be relatively straight forward but think carefully about what to test and in what order. 
Moving from small unit tests to test internal behaviour to overall correctness should give you a working solution.

Note the specification above is under specified so you'll need to make some design choices yourself.
