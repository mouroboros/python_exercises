# Roman Numerals Kata

## Introduction

Write a function which converts integers to Roman Numerals (strings)

* 1, 2, 3, become I, II, III respectively
* 5 and 10 become V, X respectively 
* 6 becomes VI
* 4 becomes IV

You should ensure your code runs correctly for any integer up to 1000.

Remember this is a Kata - follow TDD as strictly as possible.

1. Write a failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass the failing test
3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 until 
4. Your code passes the tests and you understand enough to refactor.
